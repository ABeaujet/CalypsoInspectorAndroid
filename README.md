# Calypso Inspector (Android)

This project is the Android port of [Calypso Inspector](http://github.com/ABeaujet/CalypsoInspector).

This is my first time publishing an Android app onto GitHub so the import process may be a bit rough.

This version is still in a very alpha state. A nicer UI, update manager and contribution activity are to come.

For more details, check out the main repo.
